## Deep Learning Model Training
Trained a deep learning model to recognize images using Python. The process included data preprocessing, defining a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, and training the model with TensorFlow and Keras. Key steps involved loading and augmenting the image dataset, normalizing pixel values, splitting the data into training and validation sets, and configuring the CNN with layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense. The model was trained by iteratively optimizing its parameters to minimize loss. Performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy and loss on the validation set, ensuring the model's ability to generalize well to new images.

## Deep Learning Model Training
Used Python to train a deep learning model. The process involved data preprocessing, defining a neural network architecture, and training the model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model's performance was evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy and loss. Key steps included loading and cleaning the dataset, normalizing inputs, splitting data into training and testing sets, and iteratively optimizing the model's parameters to minimize error. Finally, the model's predictions were compared against the test set to assess its accuracy and generalization capability.
